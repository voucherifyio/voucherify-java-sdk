## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
|**_object** | **String** | The type of the object represented by JSON. This object stores information about customers in a dictionary. |
|**dataRef** | **String** | Identifies the name of the attribute that contains the array of customer objects. |
|**customers** | [**List&lt;CustomerWithSummaryLoyaltyReferrals&gt;**](CustomerWithSummaryLoyaltyReferrals.md) | Contains array of customer objects. |
|**total** | **Integer** | Total number of customers. |
|**hasMore** | **Boolean** | As query results are always limited (by the limit parameter), the &#x60;has_more&#x60; flag indicates if there are more records for given filter parameters. This lets you know if you can run another request (with a different end date filter) to get more records returned in the results. |
